The receptor is aberrantly expressed in numerous cancers\nsuch as those of the lung, colon, and prostate. An individual with autism and multiple exostoses \nwas found to have a balanced translocation between chromosome 8 and a chromosome X breakpoint\nlocated within the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor gene.']","in 1 mL HPLC grade methanol

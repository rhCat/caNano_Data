ChemD and IN_NWU_SEbrahimiAngewChemIntEd2021-01,109969408,Fluorophore,thiazole orange,NaN,imaging function,,NaN,"The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green-fluorescent FIT-aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&amp;#8197;&amp;#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&amp;lt;30&amp;#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate-reader), and low sample volumes (10&amp;#8197;&amp;#956;L).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878237

Herein, we explore how spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), an emerging class of nanotherapeutic materials, can be used to deliver peptide antigens and nucleic acid adjuvants to raise immune responses that kill cancer cells, reduce (or eliminate) tumor growth, and extend life in three established mouse tumor models. Three SNA structures that are compositionally nearly identical but structurally different markedly vary in their abilities to cross-prime antigen-specific CD8 T cells and raise subsequent antitumor immune responses. Importantly, the most effective structure is the one that exhibits synchronization of maximum antigen presentation and costimulatory marker expression. In the human papillomavirus-associated TC-1 model, vaccination with this structure improved overall survival, induced the complete elimination of tumors from 30% of the mice, and conferred curative protection from tumor rechallenges, consistent with immunological memory not otherwise achievable.

TAMs are know to suppress the immune system, induce pro-tumoral functions and inhibit anti-tumor responses associated with chemotherapy. In this study, we have evaluated the synergistic efficacy of TAM repolarization and intraperitoneal paclitaxel in epithelial ovarian cancers. We demonstrate that hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles encapsulating miR-125b (HA-PEI-miR-125b) can specifically target TAMs in the peritoneal cavity of a syngeneic ID8-VEGF ovarian cancer mouse model and can repolarize macrophages to an immune-activating phenotype. These HA-PEI-miR-125b nanoparticles in combination with intraperitoneal paclitaxel can enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of paclitaxel during the later stages of disease progression as seen by the significant reduction in the ascitic fluid and peritoneal VEGF levels. Furthermore, these HA-PEI-miR-125b nanoparticles do not induce systemic toxicity and thus warrant a further evaluation in the clinical setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288064

MGO was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cetuximab (CET, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody) to obtain MGO-PEG-CET. Since EGFR was highly expressed on the tumor cell surface, MGO-PEG-CET was used for dual targeted delivery an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The physico-chemical properties of MGO-PEG-CET were fully characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and superconducting quantum interference device. Drug loading experiments revealed that DOX adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm with a maximal drug loading capacity of 6.35 mg/mg, while DOX release was pH-dependent with more DOX released at pH 5.5 than pH 7.4. Using quantum-dots labeled nanocarriers and confocal microscopy, intracellular uptakes of MGO-PEG-CET by high EGFR-expressing CT-26 murine colorectal cells was confirmed to be more efficient than MGO. This cellular uptake could be inhibited by pre-incubation with CET, which confirmed the receptor-mediated endocytosis of MGO-PEG-CET. Magnetic targeted killing of CT-26 was demonstrated in vitro through magnetic guidance of MGO-PEG-CET/DOX, while the photothermal effect could be confirmed in vivo and in vitro after exposure of MGO-PEG-CET to near-infrared (NIR) laser light. In addition, the biocompatibility tests indicated MGO-PEG-CET showed no cytotoxicity toward fibroblasts and elicited minimum hemolysis. In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of MGO-PEG-CET/DOX toward CT-26 cells was 1.48 &amp;#181;g/mL, which was lower than that of MGO-PEG/DOX (2.64 &amp;#181;g/mL). The IC50 value could be further reduced to 1.17 &amp;#181;g/mL after combining with photothermal therapy by NIR laser light exposure. Using subcutaneously implanted CT-26 cells in BALB/c mice, in vivo anti-tumor studies indicated the relative tumor volumes at day 14 were 12.1 for control (normal saline), 10.1 for DOX, 9.5 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX, 5.8 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX + magnet, and 0.42 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX + magnet + laser.

MGO was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cetuximab (CET, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody) to obtain MGO-PEG-CET. Since EGFR was highly expressed on the tumor cell surface, MGO-PEG-CET was used for dual targeted delivery an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The physico-chemical properties of MGO-PEG-CET were fully characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and superconducting quantum interference device. Drug loading experiments revealed that DOX adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm with a maximal drug loading capacity of 6.35 mg/mg, while DOX release was pH-dependent with more DOX released at pH 5.5 than pH 7.4. Using quantum-dots labeled nanocarriers and confocal microscopy, intracellular uptakes of MGO-PEG-CET by high EGFR-expressing CT-26 murine colorectal cells was confirmed to be more efficient than MGO. This cellular uptake could be inhibited by pre-incubation with CET, which confirmed the receptor-mediated endocytosis of MGO-PEG-CET. Magnetic targeted killing of CT-26 was demonstrated in vitro through magnetic guidance of MGO-PEG-CET/DOX, while the photothermal effect could be confirmed in vivo and in vitro after exposure of MGO-PEG-CET to near-infrared (NIR) laser light. In addition, the biocompatibility tests indicated MGO-PEG-CET showed no cytotoxicity toward fibroblasts and elicited minimum hemolysis. In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of MGO-PEG-CET/DOX toward CT-26 cells was 1.48 &amp;#181;g/mL, which was lower than that of MGO-PEG/DOX (2.64 &amp;#181;g/mL). The IC50 value could be further reduced to 1.17 &amp;#181;g/mL after combining with photothermal therapy by NIR laser light exposure. Using subcutaneously implanted CT-26 cells in BALB/c mice, in vivo anti-tumor studies indicated the relative tumor volumes at day 14 were 12.1 for control (normal saline), 10.1 for DOX, 9.5 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX, 5.8 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX + magnet, and 0.42 for MGO-PEG-CET/DOX + magnet + laser.

AXT050 conjugated to PLGA-PEG NPs at precisely controlled surface density functions both as a targeting agent to human tumor cells and demonstrates the potential for simultaneous antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic activity. These targeted NPs cause inhibition of adhesion and proliferation in vitro when added to human triple-negative breast cancer cells and microvascular endothelial cells through binding to integrin avb3. Furthermore, we find an in vivo biphasic relationship between tumor targeting and surface coating density of NPs coated with AXT050. NPs with an intermediate level of 10% peptide surface coating show approximately twofold greater accumulation in tumors and lower accumulation in the liver compared to nontargeted PLGA-PEG NPs in a murine biodistribution model. Display of biomimetic peptides from NP surfaces to both target and inhibit cancer cells has the potential to enhance the activity of cancer nanomedicines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424479

Herein, magnetic nanospheres (MNs) were fabricated by a convenient and highly controllable layer-by-layer assembly method. The MNs were nanosized with fast magnetic response, and nearly all of the MNs could be captured by 1 min attraction with a commercial magnetic scaffold. In addition, the MNs were very stable without aggregation or precipitation in whole blood and could be re-collected nearly at 100% in a monodisperse state. Modified with anti-epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM) antibody, the obtained immunomagnetic nanospheres (IMNs) successfully captured extremely rare tumor cells in whole blood with an efficiency of more than 94% via only a 5 min incubation. Moreover, the isolated cells remained viable at 90.5 &#194;&#177; 1.2%, and they could be directly used for culture, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunocytochemistry (ICC) identification. ICC identification and enumeration of the tumor cells in the same blood samples showed high sensitivity and good reproducibility. Furthermore, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples, and even one CTC in the whole blood sample was able to be detected, which suggested they would be a promising tool for CTC enrichment and detection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24313365

The synthetic procedure consists of 3 steps, of which the first two comprise the synthesis of a poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) template and the synthesis of a shell by using acrylic acid (AA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) as monomers, and divinyl benzene (DVB) as cross-linker. The third step of the procedure refers to the formation of magnetic nanoparticles on the microsphere&apos;s surface. AA that attaches pH-sensitivity in the microspheres and magnetic nanoparticles in the inner and the outer surface of the microspheres, enhance the efficacy of this intelligent drug delivery system (DDS), which constitutes a promising approach toward cancer therapy. A number of experimental techniques were used to characterize the resulting microspheres. In order to investigate the in vitro controlled release behavior of the synthesized microspheres, we studied the Dox release percentage under different pH conditions and under external magnetic field. Hyperthermia caused by an alternating magnetic field (AFM) is used in order to study the doxorubicin (Dox) release behavior from microspheres with pH functionality. The in vivo fate of these hybrid-microspheres was tracked by labeling them with the &#206;&#179;-emitting radioisotope (99m)Tc after being intravenously injected in normal mice. According to our results, microsphere present a pH depending and a magnetic heating, release behavior. As expected, labeled microspheres were mainly found in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The highlights of the current research are: (i) to illustrate the advantages of controlled release by combining hyperthermia and pH-sensitivity and (ii) to provide noninvasive, in vivo information on the spatiotemporal biodistribution of these microsphere by dynamic &#206;&#179;-imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286923

This study highlights the potential of dissolving microneedle (MN) arrays laden with nanoencapsulated antigen to increase vaccine immunogenicity by targeting antigen specifically to contiguous DC networks within the skin. Following in situ uptake, skin-resident DCs were able to deliver antigen-encapsulated poly-d,l-lactide-co-glycolide (PGLA) nanoparticles to cutaneous draining lymph nodes where they subsequently induced significant expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, we show that antigen-encapsulated nanoparticle vaccination via microneedles generated robust antigen-specific cellular immune responses in mice. This approach provided complete protection in vivo against both the development of antigen-expressing B16 melanoma tumors and a murine model of para-influenza, through the activation of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells that resulted in efficient clearance of tumors and virus, respectively. In addition, we show promising findings that nanoencapsulation facilitates antigen retention into skin layers and provides antigen stability in microneedles.

However, its limited depth of light penetration makes direct clinical translation challenging. Therefore, a more suitable way to harness its attributes in a clinical setting would be to couple Raman spectroscopy with endoscopy. The use of an accessory Raman endoscope in conjunction with topically administered tumor-targeting Raman nanoparticles during a routine colonoscopy could offer a new way to sensitively detect dysplastic lesions while circumventing Raman&apos;s limited depth of penetration and avoiding systemic toxicity. In this study, the natural biodistribution of gold surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles is evaluated by radiolabeling them with (64) Cu and imaging their localization over time using micropositron emission tomography (PET). Mice are injected either intravenously (IV) or intrarectally (IR) with approximately 100 microcuries (&amp;#956;Ci) (3.7 megabecquerel (MBq)) of (64) Cu-SERS nanoparticles and imaged with microPET at various time points post injection. Quantitative biodistribution data are obtained as % injected dose per gram (%ID g(-1)) from each organ, and the results correlate well with the corresponding microPET images, revealing that IV-injected mice have significantly higher uptake (p &lt; 0.05) in the liver (5 h = 8.96% ID g(-1); 24 h = 8.27% ID g(-1)) than IR-injected mice (5 h = 0.09% ID g(-1); 24 h = 0.08% ID g(-1)). IR-injected mice show localized uptake in the large intestine (5 h = 10.37% ID g(-1); 24 h = 0.42% ID g(-1)) with minimal uptake in other organs. Raman imaging of excised tissues correlate well with biodistribution data. These results suggest that the topical application of SERS nanoparticles in the mouse colon appears to minimize their systemic distribution, thus avoiding potential toxicity and supporting the clinical translation of Raman spectroscopy as an endoscopic imaging tool.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21608124

The MPRs were detected by all three modalities with at least a picomolar sensitivity both in vitro and in living mice. Intravenous injection of MPRs into glioblastoma-bearing mice led to MPR accumulation and retention by the tumors, with no MPR accumulation in the surrounding healthy tissue, allowing for a noninvasive tumor delineation using all three modalities through the intact skull. Raman imaging allowed for guidance of intraoperative tumor resection, and a histological correlation validated that Raman imaging was accurately delineating the brain tumor margins.

Pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies in rats showed that the NPs had a blood circulation half-life of about 20 hours and minimal liver accumulation. In tumor-bearing mice, DTXL-TNP exhibited markedly enhanced tumor accumulation at 12 hours and prolonged tumor growth suppression compared to a solvent-based DTXL formulation (sb-DTXL).

Demo-2,31358979,small molecule,diaminobutane,NaN,imaging function,,NaN,"Aims: Thrombogenicity associated with the induction of leukocyte procoagulant activity (PCA) is a common complication in sepsis and cancer. Since nanoparticles are increasingly used for drug delivery, their interaction with coagulation systems is an important part of the safety assessment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of nanoparticle physicochemical properties on leukocyte PCA, and to get insight into the mechanism of PCA induction. Materials &amp; Methods: A total of 12 formulations of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, varying in size and surface charge, were studied in vitro using recalcification time assay. Results: Irrespective of their size, anionic and neutral dendrimers did not induce leukocyte PCA in vitro. Cationic particles induced PCA in a size- and charge-dependent manner. The mechanism of PCA induction was similar to that of doxorubicin. Cationic dendrimers were also found to exacerbate endotoxin-induced PCA. Conclusion: PAMAM dendrimer-induced leukocyte PCA depends on particle size, charge and density of surface groups.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21957862

Here, we show in vivo SWNT drug delivery for tumor suppression in mice. We conjugate paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, to branched polyethylene glycol chains on SWNTs via a cleavable ester bond to obtain a water-soluble SWNT-PTX conjugate. SWNT-PTX affords higher efficacy in suppressing tumor growth than clinical Taxol in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model, owing to prolonged blood circulation and 10-fold higher tumor PTX uptake by SWNT delivery likely through enhanced permeability and retention. Drug molecules carried into the reticuloendothelial system are released from SWNTs and excreted via biliary pathway without causing obvious toxic effects to normal organs.

This study describes a novel mechanism to overcome MDR through a polymer-blend nanoparticle platform that delivers a combination therapy of C6-ceramide (CER), a synthetic analog of an endogenously occurring apoptotic modulator, together with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX), in a single formulation. The PTX/CER combination therapy circumvents another cellular mechanism whereby MDR develops, by lowering the threshold for apoptotic signaling. In vivo studies in a resistant subcutaneous SKOV3 human ovarian and in an orthotopic MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma xenograft showed that the PTX and CER nanoparticle combination therapy reduced the final tumor volume at least twofold over treatment with the standard PTX therapy alone. The study also revealed that the cotherapy accomplished this enhanced efficacy by generating an enhancement in apoptotic signaling in both tumor types. Additionally, acute evaluation of safety with the combination therapy did not show significant changes in body weight, white blood cell counts, or liver enzyme levels. The temporal-controlled nanoparticle delivery system presented in this study allows for a simultaneous delivery of PTX + CER in breast and ovarian tumor model drug, leading to a modulation of the apoptotic threshold. This strategy has tremendous potential for effective treatment of refractory disease in cancer patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20143195

In vitro release studies of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran (mol wt. 70 000 Da), when encapsulated in gelatin and thiolated gelatin nanoparticles (150-250 nm in diameter), was found to be affected by the presence of glutathione (GSH) in the medium. The presence of GSH was found to enhance the release by about 40% in case of thiolated gelatin and about 20% in gelatin nanoparticles under similar conditions of temperature and GSH concentrations. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of transfection in NIH-3T3 murine fibroblast cells by the nanoparticles carrying plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-N1) was done by fluorescence confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Qualitative results showed highly efficient expression of GFP that remained stable for up to 96 h. Quantitative results from FACS showed that the thiolated gelatin nanoparticles (SHGel-20) were significantly more effective in transfecting NIH-3T3 cells than other carrier systems examined.

Bombesin (BBN) peptides have demonstrated high affinity toward gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors in vivo that are overexpressed in prostate, breast, and small-cell lung carcinoma. We have synthesized a library of GRP receptor-avid nanoplatforms by conjugating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with BBN peptides. Cellular interactions and binding affinities (IC(50)) of AuNP-BBN conjugates toward GRP receptors on human prostate cancer cells have been investigated in detail. In vivo studies using AuNP-BBN and its radiolabeled surrogate (198)AuNP-BBN, exhibiting high binding affinity (IC(50) in microgram ranges), provide unequivocal evidence that AuNP-BBN constructs are GRP-receptor-specific showing accumulation with high selectivity in GRP-receptor-rich pancreatic acne in normal mice and also in tumors in prostate-tumor-bearing, severe combined immunodeficient mice. The i.p. mode of delivery has been found to be efficient as AuNP-BBN conjugates showed reduced RES organ uptake with concomitant increase in uptake at tumor targets. The selective uptake of this new generation of GRP-receptor-specific AuNP-BBN peptide analogs has demonstrated realistic clinical potential in molecular imaging via x-ray computed tomography techniques as the contrast numbers in prostate tumor sites are severalfold higher as compared to the pretreatment group (Hounsfield unit = 150).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20410458

This imprint lithographic technique called PRINT (Particle Replication In Non-wetting Templates), takes advantage of the unique properties of elastomeric molds comprised of a low surface energy perfluoropolyether network, allowing the production of monodisperse, shape-specific nanoparticles from an extensive array of organic precursors. This engineered nature of particle production has a number of advantages over the construction of traditional nanoparticles such as liposomes, dendrimers, and colloidal precipitates. The gentle &quot;top down&quot; approach of PRINT enables the simultaneous and independent control over particle size and shape, composition, and surface functionality, and permits the loading of delicate cargos such as small organic therapeutics and biological macromolecules. Thus, this single tool serves as a comprehensive platform for the rational design and investigation of new nanocarriers in medicine, having applications ranging from therapeutics to advanced diagnostics. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted, demonstrating the future utility of PRINT particles as delivery vectors in nanomedicine. Monodisperse 200 nm poly(ethylene glycol)-based (PEG) particles were fabricated using PRINT methodology and characterized via scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Incubation with HeLa cells showed very little cytotoxicity, even at high concentrations. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [(125)I]-labeled particles were studied in healthy mice following bolus tail vein administration. The particles were distributed mainly to the liver and the spleen with an apparent distribution t(1/2) of approximately 17 min followed by slow redistribution with a t(1/2) of 3.3 h. The volume of distribution for the central and peripheral compartments was found to be approximately 3 mL and 5 mL, respectively.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17643544

Athymic nude mice bearing human melanoma tumors were intravenously injected with alpha-nu-beta-3-integrin-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles, nontargeted paramagnetic nanoparticles, or alpha-nu-beta-3-targeted-nonparamagnetic nanoparticles 2 hr before they were injected with alpha-nu-beta-3-integrin-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles (i.e., in vivo competitive blockade) and imaged with MRI. Contrast enhancement of neovascularity in animals that received alpha-nu-beta-3- targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles increased 173% by 120 min. Signal contrast with nontargeted paramagnetic nanoparticles was approximately 50% less than that in the<br>targeted group (P &lt; 0.05). Molecular MRI results were corroborated<br>by histology.

In this model system, the activity of the anti-GFP conjugate can be conveniently detected by green fluorescence protein (GFP), leading to in Vitro experiments more direct and facile than those of tumor antibodies. Objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that each gadofulleride aggregate conjugated on average five anti-GFPs, and the activity of anti-GFPs was preserved after conjugation. In addition, the gadofulleride/antibody conjugate<br>exhibited higher water proton relaxivity (12.0 mM-1 s-1) than the parent gadofulleride aggregate (8.1 1/mM/s) in phosphate buffered saline at 0.35 T, as also confirmed by T1-weighted images of phantoms.

As the apoptosis-regulating caspases are activated during the apoptotic process,<br>several caspase-hydrolyzable, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based substrates have been marketed for the detection of apoptosis. However, the applicability of these agents is limited because of their nonspecificity and the consequent high background fluorescence in tissues. Here we show the synthesis, characterization, and in vitro targeting of an engineered PAMAM nanodevice in which folic acid (FA) is conjugated as the targeting<br>molecule and a caspase-specific FRET-based agent (PhiPhiLux G1D2) is conjugated as the apoptosis-detecting agent. This conjugate specifically targets FA-receptor-positive, KB cells. In these cells, the apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine caused a 5-fold increase in the cellular fluorescence. These results show, for the first time,<br>the potential applicability of a targeted apoptosis-measuring nanodevice, which could be used for simultaneously monitoring<br>the apoptotic potential of a delivered drug.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17206782
